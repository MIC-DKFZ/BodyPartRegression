- add descritpion of how to train the model 
    - explain how to evaluate with the normalized MSE 
    - example of train and validation dataset annotations 
    - write this as well into the readme 

- add tests 
    - add regression tests and define test-cases at the end to ensure consistency

- docmentation 
    - add doc-strings 
    - only use english for documentation 
    - define types in functions/classes

- go through # TODO in Code
- convert the directory to a python module
- make the code work for different GPU-capabilities (predict-method)

- src
    - addapt slope-mean and slope-std value

- inference model instead of predict.py + load_model
     - use in modelEval class 
- plots  
- tdd

## Todos 

- Training a BPR model (IN PROGRESS)
    For Training a BPR model it is important to have lots of different studies and volumes (preferably more than 1000 volumes). <br>
    For demonstration a BPR model is trained with a small dataset and a small image size of 64 px x 64 px in the following notebook:  <br>
    *documentation/notebooks/train-bpr-model.ipynb* <br>
    Please read the paper from [Yan et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03891.pdf) and the Methods & Experiments section from the master thesis to 
    understand the theoretical foundations behind the BPR model. The main pittfalls of training a body part regression model are: 
    - using not enough data augmentation techniques, so that the model can overfitt on certain studies or patients
    - using to less data 
    - haveing to much data with a wrong axis ordering in the dataset 
    - A very valuable source for getting data for a body part regression model is [The Cancer Image Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/).
